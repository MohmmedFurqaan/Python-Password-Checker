🔐 **Password Checker – Have I Been Pwned API**
This Python script checks how many times your password has been leaked in data breaches using the Have I Been Pwned API.

🚀 How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the script's directory.
3. Run the script with your password as an argument:

bash
python pswrd.py "your-password"

(Replace "your-password" with the password you want to check.)
⚠️ **Security Notice**
Never enter real passwords directly in the command line!
This script uses k-anonymity, meaning your full password is never sent to the API.
